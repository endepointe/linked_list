	An implementation of a linear linked list.


	Start at the driver.cpp file to begin testing for 
	the various forms of putting values into the 
	list, such as:
		
		- push_front(int value)
		- push_back(int value)
		- insert(int value, int position)

	You will find these functions commented. Feel free 
	to use all of them once, or individually.

	I've written a set of function calls to help speed up 
	the testing process, feel free to use them as well!	

	Ignore the files:
		
		- derived_node.cpp
		- derived_node.h
		- tools.h
		- tools.cpp

	Those were files that I was using as a sandbox.
